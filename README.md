# A Virtual Knitting Notebook

## Purpose

Knitting can be a messy, non-linear endeavour. For example, I'll start knitting a sock, then stop working on the sock to start a much 
bigger project, then come back to finish the second sock a year later. As you can imagine, knitting the second sock is much harder than knitting the first.
If only I'd written down that trick I used to shape the heel, the number of rows to the cuff, or what kind of bind-off I used... 
"Documentation is important!" I know, but why didn't I just write down these notes in the first place?

I do have a physical notebook, but keeping track of multiple projects looks messy and disjointed, as you can't move the pages around to group each project.
Sometimes notes don't belong to a certain project, like tips/tricks that may have been discovered, or just a stray idea or thought that inspired you. In a physical notebook, these little free-floating notes can easily be lost.
As well, you can't easily paste in pictures, charts, or videos you might want to reference later. 

I hope this virtual knitting notebook will solve many of these issues and encourage me to document my process more often.
*Note, this is not meant to replace Ravelry, a wonderful website with **many** functionalities. I simply wanted a more free-form virtual space to document my thoughts*
